uploading image as inline base64 img tag on Github comment

# Why you use this extension

Mainly for security reason.
Whether your Github repository is private or not, image URL uploaded on Github Issue/PR/Comment is public.
so if you don't wanna let your file public, this is one of the solutions.

# Limitation

- Max image size is 100kb (for github max text length 65535)
- This extension is also needed for showing inline base64 image (Github has not supported previewing base64 image yet officially)
